    <h2 class="h2">Description</h2>

    <p class="para">
      These deviled eggs made with Worcestershire sauce and horseradish appeared
      on the table at every holiday and other gathering when I was growing up.
      My children will stand in front of the refrigerator and eat one after
      another — if I don't catch them! You can spice these up with Creole-style
      or country mustard, a few dashes (or more!) of hot sauce, and a sprig of
      parsley. They're just pretty!
    </p>

    <h2 class="h2">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="main-1">
      <li>8 large eggs</li>
      <li>⅓ cup mayonnaise</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons cream-style horseradish sauce</li>
      <li>1 drop hot pepper sauce, or to taste</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried parsley flakes, for garnish</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon paprika, for garnish</li>
    </ul>

          Place eggs into a saucepan in a single layer and cover with water by 1
          inch. Cover the saucepan and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat and
          let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Drain and cool under cold
          running water in the sink.

          Peel cool eggs and cut in half lengthwise. Place yolks into a mixing
          bowl and set whites aside. Mash yolks with a fork until smooth; stir
          in mayonnaise, Worcestershire sauce, horseradish, hot sauce, salt, and
          pepper. Spoon yolk mixture into a heavy plastic bag; snip a corner off
          the bag to create a 1/2-inch opening. Pipe yolk mixture into egg white
          halves. Chill for at least 30 minutes before serving. Sprinkle with
          parsley and paprika to garnish.
