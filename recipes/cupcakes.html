    <h2 class="h2">Ingredients</h2>

    <ul class="main-1">
      <h3>Cupcakes:</h3>
      <li>1 (18.25 ounce) box yellow cake mix (such as Betty Crocker®)</li>
      <li>1 cup water</li>
      <li>3 eggs</li>
      <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
      <li>7 tablespoons strawberry jam</li>
    </ul>

    <ul class="main-1">
      <h3>Strawberry Topping:</h3>
      <li>1 pound fresh strawberries, hulled and quartered</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons lemon juice</li>
    </ul>

    <ul class="main-1">
      <h3>Whipped Cream:</h3>
      <li>2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons confectioners' sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="h2">Steps</h2>
    <ol class="main-2">
      <li>
        <p>
          Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups
          or line with paper liners.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Beat cake mix, water, eggs, and oil together in a bowl using an
          electric mixer on low speed for 30 seconds; increase speed to medium
          and beat until batter is smooth, about 2 minutes more. Spoon batter
          into the prepared muffin cups.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center
          comes out clean, 12 to 17 minutes. Cool cupcakes in the tin for 5
          minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Stir strawberry jam in a bowl until it reaches a smooth and spreadable
          texture. Spread a thin layer of jam onto each cupcake. Refrigerate
          cupcakes until jam has set into the cake, 3 hours to overnight.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Mix strawberries, white sugar, and lemon juice together in a bowl
          until evenly combined; refrigerate until strawberries are slightly
          broken down, at least 3 hours.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Beat cream, confectioners' sugar, and vanilla extract together in a
          bowl using an electric mixer until soft peaks form and whipped cream
          is light and fluffy.
        </p>    
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Top each cupcake with 3 or 4 slices strawberry and about 2 tablespoons
          whipped cream.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
